## Usage

Set your printer to also print background images, if not already selected. Your sign wont look as nice without them. Also set the scale to 100% and print in landscape.

## Development

```
npm i
npm run dev
open http://localhost:3000/
```

## Deployment

Run `npm run generate`, wait for the build to finish and push to GitHub.
